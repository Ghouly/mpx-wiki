# Linear rail lubrication



At start:

We are NOT building spaceship, be relax.

Under light load conditions such as 3D printers we don't need to pay more attention on this.



## Recommened Lube:

* Generic White Lithium Grease 

They are very cheap and easy to source

* Mobil EP 2 Grease 

The most common one, you should be able to source it at Amazon or local store.

* Superlube 



The type of lubricating grease is not important as we thought, $5/ounce of grease and $50/ounce of grease do not bring significant changes.



## Lube Rails

### By the surface of rail (Recommened)

Just apply some grease on the top/side surface of the rails, especially the grooves on the side.

Slide the carriager for a few times to allow the grease on the surface of the rail to enter the carriager and evenly coat the guide rail. 







### By carriager oil hole

The hole of the carriager is blocked by the dust block by default, but you use use an injector to do it.

After that you can use injector to injuct grease.
