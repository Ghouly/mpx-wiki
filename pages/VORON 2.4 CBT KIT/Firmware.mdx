##  Universal firmware 

We have pirnter.cfg for the 350 and 300, and no further configuration is needed for our standard kit as long as follow our wiring guide. For Chaoticlab CNC tap and Disco LED, you need to follow `configuration for specific hardware` 



Please check it at github.

## Slicer Setting

Start G-code

```
M190 S[bed_temperature_initial_layer_single]
M109 S150
PRINT_START 
M109 S[nozzle_temperature_initial_layer]
```

End G-code

```
PRINT_END
```





## Configuration For Specific Hardware

### Chaoticlab CNC Tap

It doesn't need special setting.

### Disco LED

Uncomment from line 384-398 in `printer.cfg`

#### Klipper-neopixel

> The Disco LED has some cool uses, such as using it as a progress bar for printing, indicating extruder temperature or printing speed, you can check it at https://github.com/digitalninja-ro/klipper-neopixel

Our Disco is controlled by two independent pins, so you can choose to use them for the same purpose or for different purposes. For example, you can use the left to display extruder temperature and the right to show print progress.

### Rapido Thermistor

Use `ATC Semitec 104NT-4-R025H42G` instead of the stock `generic 3950`

## Tuning 

There's a good tuning guide, strongly recommened to follow that: https://ellis3dp.com/Print-Tuning-Guide/

## Typical Info

Chamber Temp: with 110C buildplate, chamber temp would be around 60C.

VFA: Setting the outwall speed to greater than 200mm/s can effectively avoid VFA. We use 350mm/s on our own printer.

Input shaper result: Typical X acceleration of 10000, Y acceleration of 5000.
